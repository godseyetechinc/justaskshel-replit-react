## Usage Examples

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Complete database setup
./run_scripts.sh setup

# Or with custom database URL
./run_scripts.sh setup postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Reset database for testing
./run_scripts.sh reset

# Check database health
./run_scripts.sh check

# Run analytics queries
./run_scripts.sh utility
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Create schema only (no seed data)
./run_scripts.sh create $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL
```

## Integration Notes

### Environment Compatibility
- **Development**: Local PostgreSQL instances
- **Production**: Neon PostgreSQL serverless
- **Testing**: Isolated test databases
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing pipelines
