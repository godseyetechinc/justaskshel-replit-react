## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user
- `GET /api/login` - Initiate login flow
- `GET /api/logout` - Logout user

### Insurance Data & Quote Aggregation
- `GET /api/insurance-types` - List all coverage types
- `GET /api/providers` - List insurance providers
- `GET /api/quotes/search` - **Public endpoint** - Multi-tenant quote search with real-time provider aggregation (no authentication required)
- `GET /api/quotes/:id` - Get specific quote details
- `WS /ws/quotes` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time quote updates

#### Quote Search Authentication Details
The `/api/quotes/search` endpoint is **publicly accessible** and does not require user authentication. However, it provides enhanced functionality for authenticated users:

- **Anonymous users**: Can access basic quote search and provider aggregation
- **Authenticated users**: Receive enhanced results with organization-specific provider configurations, priorities, and commission rates
- **Multi-tenant aware**: Organization context automatically applied when user is logged in
- **Graceful fallback**: Functions normally for unauthenticated requests without organization-specific features

## How To: Enable External Provider APIs

### Check if a Provider is Using Mock Data vs Live API

To determine if a specific provider (like `jas_assure`) will make external API calls:

1. **Check Provider Configuration** in `server/insuranceProviderConfig.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "jas_assure",
     isActive: true,  // Must be true
     mockMode: !process.env.JASASSURE_API_KEY,  // If no API key, uses mock data
   }
   ```

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - If `JASASSURE_API_KEY` exists ‚Üí Live API calls enabled
   - If `JASASSURE_API_KEY` missing ‚Üí Mock mode active

3. **Verify in Server Logs**:
   - Look for provider initialization messages
   - Mock mode providers won't make HTTP requests

### Enable External API Calls for Providers

**For `jas_assure` provider:**

**In Replit (Recommended):**
1. Go to the **Secrets** pane in your Replit workspace
2. Click **"Add a new secret"**
3. Set **Key**: `JASASSURE_API_KEY`
4. Set **Value**: Your actual API key
5. Click **"Add secret"**
6. Restart the application (automatic in Replit)

**In Local Development:**
1. Set the `JASASSURE_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Restart the application
3. Provider will automatically switch from mock mode to live API calls

**General process for any provider:**
1. Find the provider's required environment variables in the config
2. Set the API key using Replit Secrets tool or environment variable
3. Optionally set custom API URL (e.g., `PROVIDER_API_URL`)
4. Restart the server to apply changes

### Troubleshooting Provider APIs

**Provider not making external calls:**
- ‚úÖ Check `isActive: true` in provider config
- ‚úÖ Verify required environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ Check server logs for connection errors
- ‚úÖ Test provider endpoint manually if needed

**Provider returning mock data:**
- ‚úÖ Environment variable missing or incorrect
- ‚úÖ Provider automatically falls back to mock mode
- ‚úÖ Set proper API key to enable live mode

### Provider Management (SuperAdmin Only)
- `GET /api/admin/provider-configs` - List all provider configurations with statistics
- `PUT /api/admin/provider-configs/:id` - Update provider configuration settings
- `POST /api/admin/provider-configs/:id/test` - Test provider API connectivity
- `GET /api/admin/provider-stats` - Get comprehensive provider performance statistics
- `GET /api/admin/external-quote-requests` - List external quote request logs with filtering

### User Management
- `GET /api/users` - List users (admin only)
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user

### Claims and Policies
- `GET /api/claims` - User claims
- `POST /api/claims` - Create claim
- `GET /api/policies` - User policies
- `POST /api/policies` - Create policy

*Note: Application workflow removed September 2025 - users now proceed directly from quotes to policies for a streamlined experience.*
