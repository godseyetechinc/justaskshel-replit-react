## Recent Enhancement: Custom HTTP Headers System 🔧

**Implementation Date:** September 2025  
**Status:** Production-Ready

### Overview
A comprehensive custom HTTP headers system has been implemented to enhance provider API integration capabilities within the claims workflow management system. This enhancement allows for flexible, secure configuration of HTTP headers at multiple levels to accommodate diverse provider authentication and communication requirements.

### Key Features

#### **Three-Tier Header Management**
- **Provider-Level Headers:** Static headers configured per insurance provider
- **Organization-Level Headers:** Headers specific to tenant organizations  
- **Request-Level Headers:** Dynamic headers passed via API requests

#### **Security Measures Implemented**
- **Header Validation:** Comprehensive validation with protected header lists
- **Case-Insensitive Protection:** Prevents bypass attempts using different letter cases
- **Header Canonicalization:** Eliminates duplicate headers that differ by case
- **Authentication Protection:** Prevents override of critical auth headers
- **Input Sanitization:** Validates header names/values, blocks injection attempts

#### **Priority Hierarchy**
```
Request-Level (Highest Priority) → Organization-Level → Provider-Level (Lowest Priority)
```

### Technical Implementation

#### **Configuration Structure**
```typescript
// Provider-level configuration
customHeaders: {
  "X-Provider-ID": "provider123",
  "X-API-Version": "v2"
}

// Organization-level configuration  
customHeaders: {
  "X-Tenant-ID": "org456",
  "X-Environment": "production"
}

// Request-level (via X-Custom-* prefix)
X-Custom-Priority: "urgent"
X-Custom-Source: "mobile-app"
```

#### **Security Validation**
- Protected headers: `authorization`, `content-type`, `user-agent`, `host`
- Character validation: Blocks CR/LF/null bytes to prevent header injection
- Case normalization: All header keys normalized to lowercase internally
- Rejection tracking: Invalid headers are logged for monitoring

### Benefits for Claims Processing

#### **Enhanced Provider Integration**
- **Flexible Authentication:** Support for diverse provider auth mechanisms
- **Custom Routing:** Headers for load balancing and environment targeting
- **Debugging Support:** Trace headers for request tracking and monitoring
- **Compliance Headers:** Meet provider-specific regulatory requirements
