- **No engagement notifications** (tier upgrades, point earnings)
- **Limited gamification** - no badges, achievements, streaks
- **No referral system** - referral points exist but no implementation

#### **3. Administrative Gaps**
- **No points rules management UI** - rules exist in database only
- **No redemption processing tools** - admins can't manage redemptions
- **No bulk operations** - can't award points to multiple users
- **Missing analytics dashboard** - no program insights

#### **4. Technical Issues**
- **No background job processing** - no scheduled tasks
- **Missing data validation** for edge cases
- **No integration points** for external activity tracking
- **Limited error handling** in complex workflows

cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', async () => {
  await storage.processPointsExpiration();
});

// Update tier levels hourly
cron.schedule('0 * * * *', async () => {
  await storage.updateAllUserTiers();
});

// Send weekly points summary emails
cron.schedule('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  await notificationService.sendWeeklyPointsSummary();
});
```
